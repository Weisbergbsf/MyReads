## Supported Browsers

By default, the generated project uses the latest version of React.

You can refer [to the React documentation](https://reactjs.org/docs/react-dom.html#browser-support) for more information about supported browsers.


### Important

The backend API uses a fixed set of cached search results and it is limited to a particular set of search terms, which can be found in [SEARCH_TERMS.md.](https://github.com/udacity/reactnd-project-myreads-starter/blob/master/SEARCH_TERMS.md) That list of terms are the only terms that will work with the backend, so don't be surprised if your searches for Basket Weaving or Bubble Wrap don't come back with any results.
